The code samples were directly taken from ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

Majority of the code was leverage from [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython).

Modified `test.py`, to be able to easily input a 32 x 32 pixel image and make prediction based on the trained nerual network model.

## Run: **python test.py**
